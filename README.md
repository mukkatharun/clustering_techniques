# K-means
K means from scratch and used on data set to predict the cluster

# Hierarchical clustering 
Here as part of hieratchical clustering, we have developed 3 types, Single, Avarage, Complete

# Gaussian mixture models 
It was developed using the sklearn.metric package

# DB Scan clustering using pycaret library
This was developed using pycaret library and few points to note for DB scan clustering.
 1. num_clusters not required for Density-Based Spatial Clustering (‘dbscan’).
 2. num_clusters param for these models are automatically determined.
